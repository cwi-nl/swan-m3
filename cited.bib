The expressivity of rewriting logic as meta-logic has been already

Implementing a compiler for a language with non-determinism features is
known to be a difficult task.
This paper presents two new functions setchp and fail that extend
the C language to efficiently handle choice point management.
Originally, these two functions were designed to compile the ELAN
strategy language. However, they can be used by programmers for general
programming in C.
We illustrate their use by presenting the classical 8-queens problem and
giving some experimental results.
Algorithms and implementation techniques are sufficiently detailed
to be easily modified and re-implemented.

@article{KirchnerM-JFP2001,
  abstract = {
  First-order languages based on rewrite rules share many features with
  functional languages. But one difference is that matching and rewriting
  can be made much more expressive and powerful
  by incorporating some built-in equational theories.
  To provide reasonable programming environments,
  compilation techniques for such languages based on rewriting have to be
  designed. This is the topic addressed in this paper. The proposed
  techniques are independent from the
  rewriting language and may be useful to build a compiler for any
  system using rewriting modulo associative and commutative (AC)
  theories.  An algorithm for many-to-one AC
  matching is presented, that works efficiently for a restricted class
  of patterns.  Other patterns are transformed to fit into this class.
  A refined data structure, namely compact bipartite graph, allows
  encoding
  all matching problems relative to a set of rewrite rules.  A few
  optimisations concerning the construction of the substitution and of
  the reduced term are described. We also address the problem of
  non-determinism related to AC rewriting and show how to handle it
  through the concept of strategies.  We explain how an analysis of
  the determinism can be performed at compile time and
  we illustrate the benefits of
  this analysis for the performance of the compiled evaluation
  process.  Then we briefly introduce the ELAN system and its
  compiler, in order to give some experimental results and comparisons
  with other languages or rewrite engines.},

  abstract = {
Implementation of a rule-based transformation engine consists of
several tasks with various abstraction levels.
We present a new tool called MTOM for the efficient implementation of
rule-based transformations. This engine should help to bridge
the gap between rewriting implementations and practical applications.
It aims at implementing well-identified parts of complex
applications where the use of rewriting is natural or crucial. These
parts are specified using rewrite rules and integrated with the
rest of the application, which is kept in a classical imperative
language such as C, C++ or Java. Our tool, which can be viewed as a YACC-like
pre-processor, does not depend on a given term representation,
rather it accepts implementation of terms (or term like data-types) of
yet existing applications and it permits to define and execute
rewrite rules upon those types. From our experiences, this system is
well-suited for industrial use as well as for implementations of
rule-based languages. The paper introduces several features supported
by MTOM.},

        current garbage collector provided with the library  and
        stress the fact that some peculiarities of this functional
        library could be taken advantage of by the memory management

        GC$^2$, a new mark-and-sweep generational garbage collector
        for the ATerm library that builds upon these peculiarities.
        Experimental results on various programs validate our

  abstract    = {We define a translation from an intermediate box language for pretty printing to \TeX. This translation can be used as a back-end for pretty printers in documentation tools for programming languages. The translation is formulated in an executable algebraic specification formalism. An important aspect of the translation is the transformation of boxes according to a set of equations. These equations preserve the text formatting semantics of boxes which is also defined algebraically. New in this approach is that algebraic transformations of box terms are used to circumvent the limitations of the typesetter.\par The \TeX\ generator, which translates the box language to \TeX\ code, is a component of documentation tools generated for the programming environments developed with the ASF+SDF meta-environment, but can also be used as a separate tool. As a case study, the construction of a typesetter for the process specification formalism PSF is shown.},

  abstract  = {An ambiguous context-free grammar defines a language in which some sentences have multiple interpretations. For conciseness, ambiguous context-free grammars are frequently used to define even completely unambiguous languages and numerous disambiguation methods exist for specifying which interpretation is the intended one for each sentence. The existing methods can be divided in `parser specific' methods that describe how some parsing technique deals with ambiguous sentences and `logical' methods that describe the intended interpretation without reference to a specific parsing technique. We propose a framework of {\em filters\/} to describe and compare a wide range of disambiguation problems in a parser-independent way. A filter is a function that selects from a set of parse trees (the canonical representation of the interpretations of a sentence) the intended trees. The framework enables us to define several general properties of disambiguation methods. The expressive power of filters is
illustrated by several case studies. Finally, a start is made with the study of efficient implementation techniques for filters by exploiting the commutativity of parsing steps and filter steps for certain classes of filters.},

  abstract   = {During the development of the ASF+SDF compiler it became clear that a simplification of the back-end could be achieved by eliminating associative lists and conditional equations in an early phase of compilation. In this thesis the transformation of conditional equational term rewrite systems with {\em associative lists} to term rewrite systems without lists is described by means of an algebraic specification. To make as much of the specification reusable the specification is written in a style called {\em Combinatory Algebraic Specification}. In this style it is possible to define polymorphic higher-order functions (or combinators) and use these as arguments to functions and as results of computations. Using this style a vast library of general purpose combinators is developed. The specification of the combinatory language, the library of combinators and the specification of the transformation are written in a {\em Literate Specification} style, meaning that the specification and the text
explaining it are integrated.},

Starting with a small kernel, several features for syntax definition are designed orthogonally to each other. This provides a framework for constructing new formalisms by adapting and extending old ones. The formalism is developed with the algebraic specification formalism ASF+SDF. It provides the following features: lexical and context-free syntax, variables, disambiguation by priorities, regular expressions, character classes and modular definitions. New are the uniform treatment of lexical syntax, context-free syntax and variables, the treatment of regular expressions by normalization yielding abstract syntax without auxiliary sorts, regular expressions as result of productions and modules with hidden imports and renamings.},

  abstract  = {This chapter introduces a modular, applicative, multi-level equational specification formalism that supports algebraic specification with user-definable type constructors, polymorphic functions and higher-order functions. Specifications consist of one or more levels numbered $0$ to $n$. Level~0 defines the object level terms. Level~1 defines the types used in the signature of level~0. In general, the terms used as types in level~$n$ are defined in level~$n+1$. This setup makes the algebra of types and the algebra of types of types, etc., user-definable. The applicative term structure makes functions first-class citizens and facilitates higher-order functions. The use of variables in terms used as types provides polymorphism (including higher-order polymorphism, i.e., abstraction over type constructors). Functions and variables can be overloaded. Specifications can be divided into modules. Modules can be imported at several levels by means of a specification lifting operation. Equations define
the semantics of terms over a signature. The formalism also allows equations over types, by means of which many type systems can be described. The typechecker presented in this chapter does not take into account type equations. \par The specification, in {\sc Asf+Sdf}, of the syntax, type system and semantics of the formalism is presented in three stages: (1) untyped equational specifications (2) applicative one-level specifications (3) modular multi-level specifications. The definition of a typechecker for stages (2) and (3) is divided into four parts: (a) well-formedness judgements verifying type correctness of fully annotated terms and specifications, (b) non well-formedness rules giving descriptive error messages for the cases not covered under (a), (c) a type assignment function annotating the terms in a plain specification with types, and (d) a typechecking function which checks well-formedness after applying type assignment. These functions are defined uniformly for all levels of a specification. \par
Aside of defining a new specification formalism, this chapter illustrates the use of {\sc Asf+Sdf} for the design and prototyping of sophisticated specification formalisms.},

  abstract    = {In first-order algebraic specification functions have types of the form $s_1\times\cdots\times{}s_n\to{}s_0$, where the $s_i$ are type constants. Such types exclude higher-order and polymorphic functions. In multi-level algebraic specification the structure of types used in function declarations is specified as an algebraic data type. If only free constructors are used in the types used in function declarations, type assignment is an extension of the Hindley/Milner algorithm to multiple levels of types. By means of equations over types, sophisticated type systems can be modeled in a simple and uniform language. The type assignment for arbitrary multi-level specifications requires $E$-unification. Although this is undecidable in general, it is decidable for restricted sets of equations.\par In an earlier paper, the modular applicative multi-level equational specification formalism MLS is defined. The typechecker supports only free type constructors.\par In this paper we introduce multi-level
specification by means of a series of MLS examples and discuss the extension with an $E$-unification procedure instead of syntactic unification of the type assignment function for MLS such that it supports type definitions, defined type operators and recursive types.},

Several optimizations are performed on the intermediate representations. The compiler is bootstrapped, i.e., it is specified in Stratego itself.
